abstract = "Abstract Five neural network (NN) models, a linear statistical model and a deterministic modelling system (DET) were evaluated for the prediction of urban NO2 and PM10 concentrations. The model evaluation work considered the sequential hourly concentration time series of NO2 and PM10, which were measured at two stations in central Helsinki, from 1996 to 1999. The models utilised selected traffic flow and pre-processed meteorological variables as input data. An imputed concentration dataset was also created, in which the missing values were replaced, in order to obtain a harmonised database that is well suited for the inter-comparison of models. Three statistical criteria were adopted: the index of agreement (IA), the squared correlation coefficient (R2) and the fractional bias. The results obtained with various non-linear NN models show a good agreement with the measured concentration data for NO2; for instance, the annual mean of the IA values and their standard deviations range from 0.86±0.02 to 0.91±0.01. In the case of NO2, the non-linear NN models produce a range of model performance values that are slightly better than those by the DET. NN models generally perform better than the statistical linear model, for predicting both NO2 and PM10 concentrations. In the case of PM10, the model performance statistics of the NN models were not as good as those for NO2 over the entire range of models considered. However, the currently available NN models are neither applicable for predicting spatial concentration distributions in urban areas, nor for evaluating air pollution abatement scenarios for future years."

We worked with a data set of the Atmospheric Monitoring System of Mexico City (SIMAT), which includes measurements hour by hour, between 2010 to 2011. The data come from of three meteorological stations: Pedregal, Tlalnepantla and Xalostoc in Mexico city. The data set includes 8 parameters: four chemical variables and four meteorological variables. Based on our results, it's possible to predict ozone levels with these parameters, with an accuracy of 94.4{\%}.",

abstract = "Abstract Ozone and PM10 constitute the major concern for air quality of Milan. This paper addresses the problem of the prediction of such two pollutants, using to this end several statistical approaches. In particular, feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs), currently recognized as state-of-the-art approach for statistical prediction of air quality, are compared with two alternative approaches derived from machine learning: pruned neural networks (PNNs) and lazy learning (LL). PNNs constitute a parameter-parsimonious approach, based on the removal of redundant parameters from fully connected neural networks; LL, on the other hand, is a local linear prediction algorithm, which performs a local learning procedure each time a prediction is required. All the three approaches are tested in the prediction of ozone and PM10; predictors are trained to return at 9 a.m. the concentration estimated for the current day. No strong differences are found between the forecast accuracies of the different models; nevertheless, LL provides the best performances on indicators related to average goodness of the prediction (correlation, mean absolute error, etc.), while PNNs are superior to the other approaches in detecting of the exceedances of alarm and attention thresholds. In some cases, data-deseasonalization is found to improve the prediction accuracy of the models. Finally, some striking features of lazy learning deserve consideration: the LL predictor can be quickly designed, and, thanks to the simplicity of the local linear regressors, it both gets rid of overfitting problems and can be readily interpreted; moreover, it can be also easily kept up-to-date."
